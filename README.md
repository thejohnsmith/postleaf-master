## Requirements

- PHP 5.5+
- MySQL 5.5.3+

## Download

**This is the development repo!** You'll need to build Postleaf using the instructions below before running it.

Download the latest ready-to-use version from: https://www.postleaf.org/download

## Contributing

Postleaf uses Composer and NPM to manage dependencies and Gulp as its task runner. To contribute to this project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the required development tools listed below.

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (Install using `npm install -g gulp-cli`)

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/postleaf/postleaf/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building

Once you have the necessary development tools installed:

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the root directory of your cloned repo
3. Run the following command:

```
composer install
```

Composer will install its own dependencies and then run `npm install`. This may take a few minutes as packages are downloaded. Once complete, Composer will trigger `gulp build` which will generate all the assets you need to run Postleaf.

**Important:** You'll also need to add [the default theme](https://github.com/Postleaf/range) to `content/themes/range/` manually. This will happen automatically once Postleaf is out of beta.

## Using Gulp

From the root directory, you can use `gulp help` to see all available tasks:

```
Usage
    gulp [TASK] [OPTIONS...]

Available tasks
    build          Run all build tasks. [build:fonts, build:images, build:prune, build:scripts, build:styles]
    build:fonts    Build font assets. [clean:fonts]
    build:images   Optimize images. [clean:images]
    build:prune    Prune unused files from vendor packages.
    build:scripts  Build scripts. [jshint, clean:scripts]
    build:styles   Build styles. [clean:styles]
    clean          Clean up generated files. [clean:fonts, clean:images, clean:scripts, clean:styles]
    clean:fonts    Delete generated fonts.
    clean:images   Delete generated images.
    clean:scripts  Delete generated scripts.
    clean:styles   Delete generated styles.
    default        Run the default task. [watch]
    help           Display this help text.
    jshint         Lint source scripts with JSHint.
    release:clean  Delete all generated releases.
    release:make   Generate a release.
    watch          Watch for script and style changes.
```

For development, use `gulp watch` to automatically compile Sass/JavaScript as you work.

## Testing

You can run Postleaf on PHP's built in web server using the following command:

```
php -S localhost:8080 -t app
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

**Note:** You might need to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in your database config!
