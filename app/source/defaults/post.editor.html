<p>Postleaf is the first open source publishing platform to feature true WYSIWYG editing. No more forms or rich-text controls â€” it's just like typing on the live webpage. Here are some tips for using the editor.</p>
<h2>The Toolbar</h2>
<p>The toolbar has all the options you're familiar with. You can format text, insert links or images, and embed content from third-party websites such as Vimeo or Instagram.</p>
<p>Postleaf strives to produce clean, semantic markup. The idea is to let authors focus on their content, not on how their content <em>looks</em>. That's why you won't find any tools to change fonts, colors, or sizes. Postleaf let's your theme do all the styling and keeps your markup free from inline CSS.</p>
<h2>Drag &amp; Drop</h2>
<p>You can insert images and other files using the <em>Images</em> and <em>Link</em> buttons, respectively. Or just drop a file into the editor. Images will be uploaded and inserted directly into your post, and other files will be uploaded and inserted as a link.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>Click the cog button to open the <em>Settings</em> panel. From there, you can fine tune each post from the URL all the way down to metadata.</p>
<p>Use the <em>History</em> tab to view all a post's past revisions. One click will show you a preview of the post at any given time. Another will revert the post back to that state, including all content, metadata, and settings.</p>
<h2>Zen Mode</h2>
<p>Inline editing is awesome, but sometimes you just want to get in the zone and focus on writing. Postleaf can accommodate you with <em>zen mode</em>. Just click the leaf button and all your styles will disappear so you can become one with your content. Another click will restore Postleaf's incredible inline editing experience.</p>
