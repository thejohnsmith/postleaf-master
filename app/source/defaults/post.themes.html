<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Postleaf templates are built with a simple but powerful template system called <em>Handlebars</em>. If you've never used Handlebars before, <a href="https://www.postleaf.org/intro-to-handlebars" target="_blank">you're in for a treat</a>.</p>
<p>Handlebar templates are easy to create and don't require any PHP programming whatsoever.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started is to open the <em>.hbs</em> files in <strong>content/themes/range</strong> and play around with them. They're just HTML files with <code>{{placeholders}}</code>, so it won't be long before you're building your own themes. For more info about themes, check out <a href="https://www.postleaf.org/tag/themes" target="_blank">these posts</a>.</p>
<p>Tip: You might need to configure your text editor to open <em>.hbs</em> files.</p>
<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>Plugins aren't supported in the beta release of Postleaf, but they're coming soon. I want to creating a solid foundation before we start building things on top of it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let me know how you'd like to extend Postleaf by tweeting to <a href="http://twitter.com/postleafapp" target="_blank">@postleafapp</a>!</p>
