<p>Hi, I'm Cory, the creator of Postleaf. Thanks for trying it out!</p>
<p>I spent the last two years building Postleaf because I wanted to bring a better publishing experience to designers, developers, and bloggers everywhere.</p>
<p>If you enjoy using Postleaf, please pay it forward by <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20@postleafapp:%20a%20free,%20open%20source%20publishing%20platform!%20https://www.postleaf.org/" target="_blank">telling someone</a> about it or <a href="https://www.postleaf.org/support" target="_blank">contributing</a> to the project.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>I've included a few sample posts to help you get started. Please read through each one to get an idea of how things work.</p>
<p>If you need help, head over to <a href="https://community.postleaf.org/" target="_blank">community.postleaf.org</a> for assistance.</p>
<h2>Admin Panel</h2>
<p>To access the admin panel, go to: <code>your-domain.com/admin</code></p>
<h2>Quick Tips</h2>
<p>Need to find something? Press <code>CMD/CTRL + P</code> to open the locater. You can search for posts, tags, users, and more with just a few keystrokes.</p>
<p>Want to delete more than one post at a time? Hold down <code>CMD/CTRL</code> and click, or select a range by holding down <code>SHIFT</code>. This works for tags and users too.</p>
<p>Postleaf saves a copy of every post you publish. From the editor, go to <em>Settings &gt; History</em> to view them. You can also view, restore, and delete revisions from the history panel.</p>
<p>Save time using keyboard shortcuts. You'll find a list of all available shortcuts <a href="https://www.postleaf.org/keyboard-shortcuts" target="_blank">in the docs</a>.</p>
<p>You can backup your entire website — including content, uploads, and themes — by going to <em>Settings &gt; Backups</em>. Postleaf will generate a single <em>.tar</em> file for your convenience.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget to update your profile! Set your avatar and tell us about yourself by filling in your bio. Head over to <em>Users</em> to do that now.</p>
